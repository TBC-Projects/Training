# Club Git Tutorial: Setting up your Environment

This tutorial will guide you through using Git, Git Bash, VS Code, and GitHub for our club projects. Even if youâ€™ve never used Git before, follow these steps carefully. Already setup? Go to [workflows](https://github.com/TBC-Projects/Training/blob/main/gitWorkflow.md).

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system. It tracks changes to files in a project so multiple people can collaborate safely.

### Key terms:

* Repository (repo): The project folder that Git tracks.

* Commit: A saved snapshot of changes.

* Branch: A separate workspace for your changes.

* Pull Request (PR): A request to merge your branch into main.

* Origin: The remote repository on GitHub.

## Install Git & VS Code

### Windows Users (via WSL)

1. Install WSL and a Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu): [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  
2. Open your WSL terminal and install Git:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```  
3. Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

4. Install the Remote - WSL extension in VS Code.

### Mac Users (via Xcode)
1. Use Xcode to install Git and/or any other tools you need for The Boring Club
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```
2. Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Configure Git
Open WSL terminal (Windows) or Terminal (Mac):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --list
```
## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```
## Create your Branch
Go to your repository page on GitHub
* Click on branch dropdown (it will likely say main)
* Type in the name you will use for your personal branch
* Click "create branch <name> from main"

Congratulations, you are now ready to make changes!
